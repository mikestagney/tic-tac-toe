# Tic-Tac-Toe.  Written in **Java.**

Command line Tic Tac Toe game for 2 human players.

## Things learned

Just a warm up exercise.  Able to reuse some of the code for Tic-Tac-Toe with AI project. I couldn't reuse as much as I wanted, since the coordinate map changed between the two projects.

### Details

First project created for JetBrains Academy Java Developer course - easy level project.

### How to play
